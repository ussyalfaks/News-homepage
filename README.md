### What I learned

Here's a short summary of what you've learned from building your site:

### Responsive Layouts: 
I effectively used Tailwind CSS to create a responsive design, ensuring your website adapts to various screen sizes by toggling between desktop and mobile images.
### Navigation: 
I've implemented a navigation menu for both desktop and mobile views, including a toggle button for small screens.

### Grid Layout: 
I applied Tailwind's grid system to arrange content in a clean, structured manner, ensuring an organized layout.
### Interactive Design: 
I utilized hover states for buttons and links to enhance user interactivity and engagement.
### Mobile-First Approach:
 By hiding and showing elements based on screen size, you demonstrated the ability to prioritize mobile user experience.

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
```
``` 
<img src="./assets/images/image-web-3-desktop.jpg" alt="Abstract colorful shapes" class="w-full object-cover hidden md:block">

<img src="./assets/images/image-web-3-mobile.jpg" alt="Abstract colorful shapes" class="w-full object-cover block md:hidden">

```
```js

overlay.addEventListener('click', () => {
    mobileNav.classList.add('translate-x-full');
    overlay.classList.add('hidden');
});
```

### Continued development

### Accessibility (a11y):

Focus on improving accessibility by using semantic HTML elements and ARIA attributes to make your site more inclusive.
Test for keyboard navigation, screen readers, and contrast ratios to ensure your website is accessible to a wider audience.

### Advanced Grid & Flexbox Layouts:

Explore more complex grid and flexbox combinations for unique layouts, especially for sections that need precise alignment.
Perfect your control over alignment, spacing, and responsive reordering of elements across different screen sizes.

### CSS Customization:

Work on integrating custom CSS more seamlessly with Tailwind. Sometimes, unique design needs require custom styles or media queries that Tailwind might not cover easily.
Experiment with using Tailwindâ€™s utility-first classes while maintaining custom brand styles for consistency.
